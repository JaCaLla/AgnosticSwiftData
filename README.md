# Agnostic Swift Data
This repository contains a sample iOS application demonstrating a basic to-do task app with a two-tabbed interface. The first tab implements Apple's recommended Swift Data framework, showcasing its integration in a straightforward manner. The second tab isolates database operations within a dedicated module, ensuring that Swift Data is not accessed directly from the view layer.

This repository serves as the foundational code for the accompanying blog post.[Agnostic Swift Data](https://javios.eu/swift/harnessing-nfc-technology-in-your-ios-app/)
